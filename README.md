# Personal Website

This project relies on my personal website build in 2021. The original project is a landing page and should still as it is, so I choose to create a separated project for a new personal website.

## Goals 

For this project I must use:

- Next.js
 - Because I'll be using next, I will change the site type from SPA to a page based site
- Typescript 
- Unit Tests 

There are some legacy dependencies I'll need to update since I'm basing the new project in a 2021 project 

## todo 

- separate mobile from desktop menu 
- declare global state properties in a separated file 
- add dark mode
