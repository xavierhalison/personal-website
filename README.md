# Personal Website

This project relies on my personal website build in 2021. The original project is a landing page and should still as it is, so I choose to create a separated project for a new personal website.

## Goals 

For this project I must use:

- Next.js
 - Because I'll be using next, I will change the site type from SPA to a page based site
- Typescript 
- Unit Tests 

There are some legacy dependencies I'll need to update since I'm basing the new project in a 2021 project:

```
babel-plugin-styled-components   1.13.2  1.13.3   2.1.4  node_modules/babel-plugin-styled-components  personal-website
react                            17.0.2  17.0.2  18.2.0  node_modules/react                           personal-website
react-dom                        17.0.2  17.0.2  18.2.0  node_modules/react-dom                       personal-website
react-feather                     2.0.9  2.0.10  2.0.10  node_modules/react-feather                   personal-website
react-scripts                     4.0.3   4.0.3   5.0.1  node_modules/react-scripts                   personal-website
styled-components                 5.3.0  5.3.11   6.1.8  node_modules/styled-components               personal-website
```
